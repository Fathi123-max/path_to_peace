    "question": "What is Jihad?",
    "answer": "Jihad literally means 'struggle' or 'striving' in Arabic. While it can refer to an internal spiritual struggle to improve oneself, it also refers to the struggle to defend Islam and protect the Muslim community.

    "question": "What do Muslims think about other religions?",
    "answer": "The Quran teaches respect for other monotheistic faiths, particularly Judaism and Christianity, which are referred to as 'People of the Book.' Muslims believe that all prophets, including Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, came from the same God. The Quran states, 'To you your religion, and to me mine' (109:6)."

    "question": "Why do some Muslim women wear headscarves?",
    "answer": "The headscarf (hijab) is worn by many Muslim women as an act of modesty and faith. It is based on guidance from the Quran that both men and women should dress modestly. For many women, it is also a symbol of religious identity and personal choice. Not all Muslim women wear the hijab, as practices can vary by culture and personal interpretation."
